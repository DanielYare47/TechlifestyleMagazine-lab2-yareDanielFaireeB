Tech & Lifestyle Weekly Website  

My name is Daniel Fairee B. Yare and my student ID is 2024303227.  

For this project, I designed a simple website inspired by *Tech & Lifestyle Weekly*. The goal was to make it look like it was created by a beginner, but with a few improvements for better readability and structure. I used a clean layout with a header, hero section, articles, newsletter, and footer. The navigation and content are kept straightforward so the site feels easy to use.  
Some design choices included using a centered logo with a header background, basic card-style articles, and simple blue tones to reflect a tech theme while keeping the layout light for lifestyle content.  
As a bonus feature, I added responsive adjustments so the site works on smaller screens, and included hover effects for navigation and buttons to make the page more interactive without looking overly advanced.
